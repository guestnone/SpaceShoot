# SpaceShoot
Final project for "Computer Architecture" subject at Bia≈Çystok University of Technology.
It's a very simple shooter in space game, nothing special.

Compilation
-----------
Uses IAR Embedded Workbench. Load the Build/IarEwb/SpaceShoot.eww into IDE and compile it in Debug mode (Release Mode probably requires the C/++ optimization options to be set into the maximum with the size priority to properly compile).
